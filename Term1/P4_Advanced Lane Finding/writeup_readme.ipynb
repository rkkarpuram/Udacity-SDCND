Having experimented with various thresholds (more of an experimental process), I ended up with acceptable threholds and binary image using gradient on both x & y directions. Used Sobel kernel sized 3 (3x3 pixels). While this identified the yellow and white lanes well, they also generated a lot of other noise across the image. Selecting a Region of Interest (ROI) to choose only the road part didn't help much. All the various edges and color variations due to shadows and other conditions added noise.\n",

    "Gradients binary is further enhanced by adding to it color thresholded binary. While on the highway, the lines are easily captured, over and around the bridge where the trees cast shadow and the road is much lighter than highway, the lanes are best identified with saturation channel for yellow (HLS) that did a very good job. Combining this with value channel of HSV color space has extracted the lane lines very well.\n",
