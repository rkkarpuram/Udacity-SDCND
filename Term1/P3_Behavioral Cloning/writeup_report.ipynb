    "\n",
    "For training, I drove the car in simulator and collected data of three laps. These are neat laps staying in centre of road. I avoided collecting data by going reverse side of lap as I augmented data with flipping the image and steering angles in opposite direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since track is mostly turning the model tends to over learn left turns. To avoid this each image is flipped vertically and its steering angle is reversed. This also resulted in data augmentation process rather than obtain more and more training data. Initially I trained the model with only centre camera input, however the car in simulaor wobbled a way too much towards either side of the road. Steering angle got smoothened once I used the images and adjusted steering agnles from the left and right cameras too, followed by same data augmentation process as above."

The data is then normalized to values between -0.5 to 0.5 for computational efficiency (code line 85).\n",

My intuition for not using finer filters of 3x3 was that it might tend to overfit to the data. Next layer is a set of 36 5x5 filters. This should learn mid level features followed by 48 3x3 filters that convolve the earlier layers. The last layer is 64 3x3 filters that look for high-level features. Each of these CNN layers are also downsampled by MaxPooling to throw away some of the spatial information, so the conv layer learns there is a specific feature, and not exactly where in the input.\n",
